\section{Project Description}
In this project we create a Q-Learning algorithm that is able to play classic,
or ``retro", videogames. These games are widely considered to be NP-Hard or
many times PSPACE-Hard\cite{DBLP}

In this project we set out to create two competitive agents that will be able to
play Super Mario Kart (SMK) against one another and the game's agents. An 
extra goal is to be able to play against these agents in a match. A full 
description of Super Mario Kart can be found in the 
\href{https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAFE.pdf}
{official documentation}.

During the project we had failed to import SMK into OpenAI's retro gym but we
were still able to successfully implement a Q-Learner that is able to play 
games that correctly import into retro. We have tested the learner on
Airstriker Genesis, the default game, and Donkey Kong Country.
